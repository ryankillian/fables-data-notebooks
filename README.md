# Fables Motif Mapping

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and related assets for the project focused on mapping fine-grained motifs from fables to broader, general themes. Using a combination of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, we aim to derive meaningful insights from the motifs present in various fables.

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: An open-source web application that allows for the creation and sharing of documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- **Google Colab**: A cloud-based platform that offers free access to GPUs and TPUs, simplifying the process of running Jupyter notebooks without any setup.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for Python. It features various algorithms like support vector machine, random forests, and k-neighbours. For this project, we primarily used its clustering algorithms, such as KMeans.
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: A transformer-based machine learning technique for natural language processing pre-training. It's designed to understand the meaning of each word in a sentence by looking at its surrounding context in both directions.
